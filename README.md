# Bankist

This is a simple Bankist app made for exercise. It was built with the help of Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course. It has some features like logout timer, transfering money between accounts, loans etc. If you want to try it out, download the code and start the live-server in your terminal. User names and passwords are:
